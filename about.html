      <p> In the era of COVID-19, humans are now relying on the internet arguably moreso than they did before. This additional time spent working from home or doing virtual school has created a larger attack surface for hackers. That is, they have more opportunities to exploit our use of the internet. <br> <br>
      While cybersecurity might not be the first topic that comes to mind when you think of socio economic issues, it is in fact a very pressing one that is often overlooked. Cybersecurity is a field that focuses largely on social impact. Aside from the importance of security to companies, all people should make their personal cybersecurity a top priority since anyone could be the target of identity theft, fraud, or maybe even a ransomware attack (where a hacker forces the victim to pay to get their data back, very detrimental for small business owners specifically). These issues are arguably most pressing to people of lower socioeconomic status because while it is true that the rich could and are targeted for their money, they also have the resources to protect themselves. However, the majority of people do not and if hit by an attack, they will likely not be able to make a full recovery and would still be vulnerable to further attacks. <br> <br> This website was created in an attempt to raise awareness on this issue and provide easy solutions which would help individuals be more secure online.
